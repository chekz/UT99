# The Lore
This project was inspired by Bunneh`.

I was streaming on Twitch, testing out some random UT99 mods, having a good time, and it inspired the Bun guy to go and look at some mods as well. He found one called SpeedRacer and after the stream finished he sent me a message on Discord describing said mod. Here is how the conversation went.

Another one
[SpeedRacer.txt]
damaging oneself in order to pass an obstacle and then regen elsewhere
kinda nice

chekz — 25/08/2023 23:15
that is interesting!

Bunneh — 25/08/2023 23:16
could a damage / regen gun be made? I think I've seen one somewhere
which incorporates the above

chekz — 25/08/2023 23:17
could be made yeah, could modify shock rife, Primary Fire damage self, Alt Fire Regen self.
